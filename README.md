Given the data provided it can be concluded that theater projects have a high success rate in the Parent Categories, as well as Plays also having a high success rate among the Sub-Categories, and that projects with a launch date in May tend to be more successful than the other months.

Limitations with this data set are that the currencies vary by country and don't show a consistent form of comparison. Also, that there's not a clear definition for some of the categories, for example what does "Staff pick" and "Spotlight" tell us.

Other possible tables and/or graphs could be showing the percent funded to the State of the project. As well as, the average donation for each of the Parent Categories and Sub-Categories.
